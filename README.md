# HIGHEST NUMBER FINDER
## Description
This Python script defines a function `findTheHighest` that finds the highest value in a list of numbers provided by the user. 
This function is implemented without using the built-in `max` function, showcasing a custom approach to determine the maximum value.
The program splits the input string into individual numbers, converts them into integers, and passes them to `findTheHighest`.
The program finally outputs the highest number or an error message in case of invalid input.

## Features
- **Custom maximum value function:** `findTheHighest` takes an undetermined number of numeric values and returns the highest value.
- **User input:** Allows users to input a series of numbers from which the highest value will be determined. User can also choose to quit the program.
- **Error handling:** The script handles invalid inputs by notifying the user and prompting for re-entry.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you will need Python installed on your system. After installing Python, proceed as follows:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   - To exit the program, type "q".

2. **Viewing Results:**
   - The script will display the highest value among the entered numbers.
   - If an invalid input is detected, an error message will prompt for correct input.
